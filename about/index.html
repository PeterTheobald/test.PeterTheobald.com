<main>
<p>I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> and <strong>computer forensics analyst</strong>; I am also a husband and geeky dad. This is my personal site with posts about <a href="/categories/tech/">programming</a>, <a href="/categories/personal/">geeky fun stuff, making things and rock climbing</a>. I also have a <a href="http://www.tcforensics.com">blog on my company website</a> that talks about forensics cases for an audience of attorneys and judges.</p>

<p>I am the owner of <a href="http://www.tcforensics.com">TC Forensics</a> – I provide computer forensics services to attorneys, law firms and the courts. I find hidden or destroyed data in computers, cell phones and other digital devices, investigate data breaches, provide litigation support and expert testimony related to computer evidence.</p>

<p>From time to time I also still develop web sites and internet-connected desktop applications.</p>

<p>For more details view my full <a href="/downloads/Peter Theobald resume.pdf">resume</a>. Some highlights are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Founded LI Net, an early Internet Service Provider, with three partners and little capital; In four years we built LI Net into the largest ISP on Long Island and one of the largest in New York. Just as we were looking at an angel round of funding to expand we accepted an acquisition offer from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verio#/entity">Verio</a>, a national roll-up of the leading regional ISPs, for over $7M cash plus Verio stock.</li>
<li>At <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lehman-brothers#/entity">Lehman Brothers</a>, I provided daily support and customizations (C++,Bash) for the Fixed-Income Derivatives department, mostly for the overnight portfolio risk management processes. A highlight was adding support for path-dependent Bermuda style options to our SUMMIT based Black-Scholes option pricing models.</li>
<li>Developed the back-end database and front-end UI for several web sites, including SponsorClick.com, AgencyAccess.com, DMLT (Investment Cafe) reporting, Wine Alert (eRobertParker.com) web scraping processes, ICS Network Systems (MailSentry) where my work was granted a U.S. patent, AllBooks4Less.com (Half.com) and more. My weapons of choice depending on the project were: C++, Python, Perl, SQL, Javascript, Cold Fusion (Java framework similar to JSP), PHP.</li>
<li>At ERI, Developed a document imaging system in C++/XWindows/Informix DB; Did installation and training for the document imaging system for Banco Bradesco in São Paolo, Brasil and for Brooklyn Union Gas in Brooklyn, New York; Also at ERI assisted the sales department in designing specs for custom solutions as a pre-sales engineer.</li>
</ul>
